set<T> can only hold ONE of each key, the keys are unique
multiset<T> can hold MULTIPLE of each key, the keys are not unique
for most of my applications, multiset is the right choice

(1 << j) is the same as 2^j

the number of pairs a*b that satisfy the inequation a*b <= x is x*log(x)

gcd(a - b, b) = gcd(a, b) when a > b

dont use upper and lower bound with pairs, create a custom struct with an < operator

you can move DSU elements individually for low performance cost - O(N log N) for all joins

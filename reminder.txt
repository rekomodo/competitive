the number of pairs a*b that satisfy the inequation a*b <= x is x*log(x)

gcd(a - b, b) = gcd(a, b) when a > b

dont use upper and lower bound with pairs, create a custom struct with an < operator

you can move DSU elements individually for low performance cost - O(N log N) for all joins

inline bool operator functions to be defined for usage of structs in sets or multisets

check if distance has already been improved before continuing to process the vertex in dijkstra

stars and bars:
you have n objects and k bins
if the bins can have 0 objects: ans = C(n + k - 1, k - 1) = C(n + k - 1, n)
if the bins have at least 1 object: ans = C(n - 1, k - 1)
